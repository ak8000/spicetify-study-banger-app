# Spicetify Creator

This is part of my team project for an Open Source class at NYU. We worked on a Spicetify project creating a custom application and a theme. You can find this app and the theme (Starry Night) on Spicetify marketplace. Spicetify Creator is a tool to compile modern Typescript/Javascript code to Spicetify extensions and custom apps.

## Features
- Typescript and React syntax
- Import node packages
- CSS/SCSS with PostCSS support
- Extremely fast compile time with esbuild.
- Plugins
